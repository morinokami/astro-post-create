# astro-post-create

Astro does not come with additional tools such as ESLint during the initial project creation process, leaving it up to users to install them manually. `astro-post-create` is a tool that enables an easy installation of these additional tools. At the moment, it supports ESLint and Prettier.

## Usage

To use `astro-post-create`, create a new Astro project using the following command:

```sh
npm create astro@latest
```

Next, navigate to the newly created project directory and run the following command:

```sh
npx astro-post-create
```
